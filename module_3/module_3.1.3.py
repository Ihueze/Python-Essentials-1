Exercises
Now let's ask a few questions. Try to guess the answers.

Question #1: What is the result of the following comparison?

2 == 2

Answer:
True - of course, 2 is equal to 2. 
Python will answer True (remember this pair of predefined literals, True and False - they're Python keywords, too).


Question #2: What is the result of the following comparison?

2 == 2.

Answer:
This question is not as easy as the first one. 
Luckily, Python is able to convert the integer value into its real equivalent, and consequently, the answer is True.

Question #3: What is the result of the following comparison?

1 == 2

Answer:
This should be easy. The answer will be (or rather, always is) False.
