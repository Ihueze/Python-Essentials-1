Questions and answers

A programmer writes a program and the program asks questions.

A computer executes the program and provides the answers. The program must be able to react according to the received answers.

Fortunately, computers know only two kinds of answers:

yes, this is true;
no, this is false.
You will never get a response like Let me think...., I don't know, or Probably yes, but I don't know for sure.

To ask questions, Python uses a set of very special operators. Let's go through them one after another, illustrating their effects on some simple examples.
